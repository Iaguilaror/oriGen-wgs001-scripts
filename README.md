# oriGen – Analysis Code

- The code in this repository are meant to reproduce results from: TO-DO-add url and doi after paper is published

Workflows for the oriGen Analysis of 1,427 whole genomes.  

Welcome! 👋  
This repository contains code used to analyze the data in the oriGen study, which involved whole-genome sequencing of 1,427 individuals. Our goal is to provide transparent and reproducible access to the workflows behind our results.

## 📄 Contents of this repository  

The oriGen study is a population-scale genomic project focused on Mexican individuals. This release includes the following subdirectories:  

- **oGpv3**: NGS preprocessing, QC, alignment and Variant Calling
- **vep-extended**: Variant Effect Annotation
- **LoFbySample**: Loss of Function variation summary
- **vcf2kinship**: Kinship Analysis with KING2
- **vcf2pcp**: ADMIXTURE and Principal Component Analysis from joint population VCF
- **cnv-analysis**: Processing of the CNV BCFs from CNVpytor
- **cov-calculation**: NGS coverage calculation by exon for CN estimation
- **viral-detection**: Detection of viral hits in sequencing data

## How to use this repository

Each workflow subdirectory contains:

* The Source code used to run analysis on a part of the paper
* A small (simulated or real) dataset to demo the code
* All software dependencies and operating systems  
* Installation instructions
* Output descriptions
* Expected runtimes

### * **No sensitive nor personal data is shared in the repositories** *

Every subdirectory includes a ./scripts/ dir with particular R, python or bash scripts for descriptive and or statistical analyses.

Every subdirectory includes a main.nf, and a modules/ subdir with the nextflow framework to run.
